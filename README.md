Designing Transaction Management with Process Scheduling for a Distributed System Across Multiple Servers Capable of Handling Millions of Transactions 

# Distributed Transaction Processing System

Welcome to the **Distributed Transaction Processing System** GitHub repository! This project involves simulating and designing an efficient process scheduling algorithm for a major e-commerce platform that handles millions of transactions daily. The platform operates on a distributed system comprising multiple servers, each running distinct services responsible for different transaction types.

## Project Overview

The core aspects of this project include:

- **Multiple Services:** The system comprises various services, with each dedicated to handling a specific transaction type (e.g., payment processing, order processing, etc.).
  
- **Worker Threads:** Each service maintains a pool of worker threads. These threads possess priority levels and assigned resources, influencing their request processing order and capabilities.
  
- **Priority & Resources:** Worker threads are prioritized, and each has specific resources allocated to it. Priority guides the order in which threads handle requests, and resources dictate the number of simultaneous requests a thread can manage.
  
- **Request Queuing:** Incoming requests are queued and routed to relevant services based on transaction type. From there, they're further queued to worker threads based on priority levels.
  
## Project Objectives

Goal is to design a process scheduling algorithm that:

- Efficiently allocates resources to worker threads.
- Prioritizes higher-priority threads.
- Adapts to transaction type-specific resource requirements.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Input**: Program reads input from standard input containing the following information:
   - Number of services (n) in the system.
   - Number of worker threads (m) for each service.
   - Priority level and assigned resources for each worker thread.
   - Type of transaction and required resources for each request.
   
2. **Output**: Program outputs the following information:
   - Order of processed requests.
   - Average waiting time for requests.
   - Average turnaround time for requests.
   - Count of rejected requests due to resource scarcity.
   
3. **High Traffic Alerts**: Additionally,  program outputs these metrics during periods of high traffic:
   - Number of requests forced to wait due to insufficient resources.
   - Number of requests blocked due to the unavailability of worker threads.
